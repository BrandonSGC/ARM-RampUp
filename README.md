# 🚀 ARM Ramp-Up Training with Microsoft

Welcome to my personal repository documenting my **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Ramp-Up Training** — a professional development initiative I’m undertaking with guidance from **Microsoft Senior Engineers**. This journey is part of my mission to deepen my expertise in **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and specialize in the architecture and capabilities of ARM.

---

## 🧠 What I'm Learning

This training is designed to build advanced skills in ARM and related Azure technologies, focusing on:

### 📐 Infrastructure as Code
- **ARM Templates**
- **Bicep**
- **Terraform**

### 🛡️ Azure Governance
- **Azure Policies**
- **Custom Policy Definitions**
- **Initiatives & Assignments**

### 🔍 Visibility and Management
- **Azure Resource Graph (ARG)** — Running complex queries for inventory and insights
- **Azure Lighthouse** — Managing multi-tenant environments securely
- **Managed Applications** — Publishing and managing packaged solutions

### 🏗️ Deep Dive into ARM Architecture
Understanding how the Azure Resource Manager works behind the scenes, including:
- Gaining a deep understanding of the entire internal process and architecture of ARM. From the moment a request is received by Azure, to how ARM orchestrates resource provisioning, validation, policy enforcement, and interaction with various resource providers.
